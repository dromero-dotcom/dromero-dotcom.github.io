## PROJECT: Customer Segmentation for an e-Commerce Business

**Project description / Problem Statement:** A logistics company operates a fleet of ships. It needs an anomaly detection system for their shipping fleet to prevent engine failures. Current maintenance issues can cause safety risks, high costs, and delivery delays. By analyzing engine sensor data for early warnings, the goal is to implement proactive monitoring that ensures crew safety, reduces operational expenses, and protects revenue through timely corrective action.

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

A dataset of about 19,500 readings was used to track various features of the engine activity: engine RPMs, oil temperature and pressure, fuel pressure, etc. Each on its own does not point to an anomaly, but combinations of several abnormal readings might suggest potential issues. Histograms and boxplots of each feature helped to identify the distribution of the data and potential outliers.
